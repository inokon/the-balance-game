The Balance Game is a Desktop/Android game born with the idea of balancing in mind, with a good variety of stages decently difficult to win, a very simple gameplay and nice graphics.
The game makes use of the most awesome cross-platform Java game/graphics development framework: LibGDX Framework: http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/


ALPHA STAGE NOTE: please note that this game is still in alpha stage, and unfortunately the development has halted some time ago, so I decided to make it open source for you for learning purposes or even if you decide to fork it and complete it. You're free to do anything with this source, just follow the license here included (Apache License 2.0), though I'd really appreciate if you let me know whenever you'd be doing cool stuff with this project!


- IDE Integration:

You should be able to import the project directly into Eclipse and compile it without issues.


- Run instructions:

Android: just copy the apk file from the android version folder to your android device and install as with any other apk file (granted it won't need strange permissions!)

Desktop: make sure you have at least Java jre6 or newer version, and just run the jar file inside the desktop version folder.


- Gameplay and Commands

The game makes use of the device accelerometer to move the objects (on desktop the mouse will do the trick), and also finger taps (or mouse click on desktop) in certain levels.
Here is a description of actual implemented levels:
